# netlink
## purpose
Netlink is an update mechanism for Java applications. The integrity is verified with the help of digital signatures.

## Deployment scenario:
Netlink is suitable for use in companies. The application is distributed once per installer and keeps itself up-to-date independently in the future. It is recommended to install an appropriate JRE locally for the application.

## Prerequisites and security:
* The first installation is carried out by an administrative user.
* The end user can only access the installation directory in read-only mode.
* Updates are kept in a cache.
* The signature verification is only effective as long as the JRE and Netlink cannot be manipulated from the outside.

## History:
Netlink was created in 2001 for the automatic update of the desktop client of BTMS Travel Expense Accounting RKAÂ². Later we only used Netlink where Java WebStart could not be used.
Since Oracle has cancelled the support of WebStart, we continue the development actively again.applicationpurpose
